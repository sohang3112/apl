# APL Practice Problems
These are solutions to questions asked in previous years in [APL Problem Solving Competition](https://www.dyalog.com/student-competition.htm).
The full set of practice problems is available [here](https://problems.tryapl.org/psets/2013.html).

## 2013
1. `¯1+2×⍳`
2. `100×≢÷⍨65+.≤⊢`
3. UNIMPLEMENTED
4. `{((0=¯1↑⊢)∧(0∧.≤⊢))+\(1 ¯1 0)['()'⍳⍵]}` - Gives correct answer using Dyalog APL 18.0, however TryAPL Practice Site reports this as incorrect.
5. `∘.=⍨⍳`
6. `{⍬≡⍵:0 ⋄ 1:(⌈/-⌊/),⍵}`
7. `{((⊢≠⌊)⍵)/⍵}`
8. `∘.×⍨⍳`
9. `{⍺÷⍨⍺+/⍵}` - **TODO:** Will tacit form work? (`⊢÷⍨+/`) 
10. `(⌹⊢)+.×⊣`

## 2014
1. `(2+.*⍨⊣)=2*⍨⊢`
2. UNIMPLEMENTED
3. UNIMPLEMENTED
4. UNIMPLEMENTED
5. UNIMPLEMENTED
6. UNIMPLEMENTED
7. UNIMPLEMENTED
8. UNIMPLEMENTED
9. UNIMPLEMENTED
10. `{100×⌈/2(-÷⊢)⍨/⍵}`

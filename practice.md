# APL Practice Problems
These are solutions to questions asked in previous years in [APL Problem Solving Competition](https://www.dyalog.com/student-competition.htm).
The full set of practice problems is available [here](https://problems.tryapl.org/psets/2013.html).

## 2013

2. `100×≢÷⍨65+.≤⊢`
3. UNIMPLEMENTED
4. `{((0=¯1↑⊢)∧(0∧.≤⊢))+\(1 ¯1 0)['()'⍳⍵]}` - Gives correct answer using Dyalog APL 18.0, however TryAPL Practice Site reports this as incorrect.

6. `{⍬≡⍵:0 ⋄ 1:(⌈/-⌊/),⍵}`
7. `{((⊢≠⌊)⍵)/⍵}`

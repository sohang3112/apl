Notes on:

- [APL](languages/apl/)
    - *Additional APL Resource*: [APL History](https://www.pldi21.org/prerecorded_hopl.2.html)
- [J](languages/j/)
- **Kap** (a new lang, in progress, uses APL characters and very similar to it!):
  - repo: https://codeberg.org/loke/array
  - its Array Editor GUI demo looks cool of spreadsheet-like features: https://blog.dhsdevelopments.com/array-languages-vs

### Tooling
- [Dyalog APL  Link](https://dyalog.github.io/link/latest/) -- new recommended way to save code in text files instead of workspace files. Version control can be done externally via Git.
- This also looks cool (spreadsheet-like GUI editor for K language): https://github.com/chrispsn/mesh-spreadsheet 

## Common Resources
